# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This is a simple project that uses various methods to find the (pseudo-)optimal path. Between having the right path and a path with a reduced complexity.

### Problem Description

The [Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city. Itâ€™s classified as an NP-hard problem in the field of combinatorial optimization.

- Given the city to start, a set of cities and the distances between them, find the optimal tour that minimizes the total distance traveled.
- Constraints: Each city must be visited exactly once, and the tour must return to the starting city.
 
### Approaches
*n := number of cities to travel (number total of cities - 1)*
1. Exact Algorithms:
  - **Brute force:** Test all possibilties, *time complexity = O(n!)*
2. Approximation Algorithms:
  - **Sorting:** Sort cities by distance from starting city, using merge sort, *time complexity = O(nlog(n))*
  - **Random:** Shuffle the list of cities and return it as a probable solution, *time complexity = O(n)*
